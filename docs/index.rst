About
*****

`readparse <https://github.com/apt-get-nat/PARSE>`_ is a lightweight python library designed to interface with the PARSE solar dataset. The dataset itself is provided in the form of specified FITS files, but this utility is served as a means of easily reading the data into python, and interpolating it onto a regular grid for plotting or comparison.
