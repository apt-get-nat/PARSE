# PARSE
The Plasma-prescribed Active Region Static Extrapolation (PARSE) dataset consists of approximagely 7,000 magnetohydrostatic simulations of coronal regions, based on almost 1,000 [SHARP images](https://github.com/mbobra/SHARPs). The intent is to provide these solutions to the community, for testing, validation and machine learning training. The extrapolations were done with a [RBF-FD-based magnetohydrostatic solver](https://github.com/apt-get-nat/RBF-MHS).

Please find the paper describing this dataset [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02138). The dataset itself will be available on [zenodo](doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8213061) as soon as their tech support person gets back to me.
